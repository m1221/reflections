LESSON 2 REFLECTIONS

	What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
		-When you initialize a repository a git repository is created for the main directory.
		The git repository is a file by the name ".git"
		-A repository must be initialized in order to be created.
	
	
	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
	What value do you think it offers?
		-The staging area links the working directory and the repository. The working
		directory is the most current state of the directory. The git repository consists
		of committed versions of the main directory.
		-The staging area helps the user organize their thoughts regarding commits.

	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
	change?

	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
	organized? How would branches help?

	How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
	the diagram the way we do?

	What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
	manually?
